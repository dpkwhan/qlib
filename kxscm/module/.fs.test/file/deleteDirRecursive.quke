      / TODO How to mock a built-in function used inside a user-defined function?
      / This does not work since hdel is used inside the function
      / deleteDirRecursive (::)
      /
      / However the following works, but this does not test the function deleteDirRecursive
      .qu.compare[`hdel each desc listDirRecursive (::); desc dir]
